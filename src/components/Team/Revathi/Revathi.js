          Revathi is the founder of Stories Design Studio, artist by birth and interior designer by choice.
          She holds an MBA in Marketing and a Bachelor’s Degree in Commerce. Her exposure to construction sites
          at an early age inspired her to passionately play with spaces and paved her way to a career in interior design.
          Revathi enjoys using bright colors with suave and light palettes creating dramatic visual appeal in the process
          and gets her inspiration from her wanderlust. She loves to work with artisans who shape beautiful articles
          with their hands and tools. She is often found at sites, closely interacting with the execution team,
          giving her an expert edge when it comes to developing designs that are practical and executable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revathi’s hobbies include creating beautiful acrylic paintings and exploring new ways of using paints.
          She is a master of many languages – fluent in English, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and Tamil.
